About:
The DM-Toolbox is an all-in-one tool designed specifically for dungeon masters to manage and run tabletop role-playing game (RPG) encounters. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, the DM-Toolbox offers a wide range of features to help streamline the DM's work.

One of the standout features of the DM-Toolbox is the ability to create new creatures or load existing ones into the encounter. You can also add any creature from the monster manual into your encounter. Once your creatures are added, you can save the encounter as a .enc file for future use or load any .enc file into the encounter.

Another large focus of the DM-Toolbox is to allow a dungeon master to focus more on their game, and less on tracking combat. Allowing the dungeon master to focus more on the tactics of their big baddies versus the nitty gritty of tracking their statistics and stat blocks. As a result a major feature of DM-Toolbox is intuitive and easy hp tracking, that allows the user to quickly add or subtract hp from a creature. Gone are the days of handwriting hp, or using a notepad to manually subtract and add the damage to a creature!

The DM-Toolbox also allows you to customize the settings, including the color of the program and the background image. You can easily save your settings or revert to the default settings.

In addition to the above features, the DM-Toolbox includes initiative tracking, a dice roller, and a creature panel. The initiative tracker lets you keep track of the order in which creatures take their turns during combat. The dice roller allows you to roll dice quickly and efficiently, without the need for physical dice. The creature panel provides a quick and easy way to view all the creatures in your encounter, including their stats and abilities.

Whether you're a new or experienced dungeon master, the DM-Toolbox is the perfect tool to help you manage your RPG encounters with ease.
